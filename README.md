Interactive rating component
## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This is a interactive rating component which we can see mostly on every website we use. I used HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript to complete this challenge by The Frontend Mentor.
Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
